			<h2>Private Student Halls</h2>
			<p>Privately owned student halls offer the convenience of renting a place with other students and have your electrity, broadband and TV licence included in your rent. These do not necessarily be viewed in advance and can be booked as long as they are available. This makes it a popular choice for many international students, as you do not need to provide UK guarantor details. These halls also often offer communal spaces for students to socialise.</p>

			<h2>Private Housing</h2>
			<p>Edinburgh also offers a large number of flats, either rented by agencies or private landlords. These are often within the old and traditional tenement buildings and offer yet another interesting living experience. Options are vast, however flats go quickly and agencies and landlords often receive multiple requests. In general, agencies will want you to view the property first. After you viewed the property and inform your agent of your choice, they normally get back to you that you can reserve the property by paying a holding deposit.
			 Once you pay this holding deposit, the agency will then prepare a contract for you that you should read carefully before signing it. It is also worth noting that you might require a guarantor to proof that you can pay your rent. Otherwise, you can often pay 6 months in advance.</p>
			<h3>Cost</h3>
			<p>The cost for private rented accommodation varies, but is generally between £300-400 per month for a room or £500-600 per month for a one-bedroom flat, not including bills and utilities. Set a clear budget of how much you are willing to pay when looking for flats to avoid signing a lease on a flat you cannot afford.</p>
			<p>If you prefer to pay rent and utilities together, there are also several private student-only accommodations run by private companies, typically going for £130-150 per week, or £520-600 per month.</p>
			<h3>Location</h3>
			<p>[INSERT MAP]</p>
			<p>Edinburgh is a vibrant city that offers many interesting neighbourhoods.
				<br>Popular areas include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Marchmont</li>
				<li>Bruntsfield</li>
				<li>Newington</li>
				<li>Tollcross</li>
				<li>Southside</li>
				<li>Fountainbridge</li>
				<li>Easter Road &#38; Abbeyhill</li>
				<li>Leith</li>
				<li>New Town</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Finding a place</h3>
			<p>To find suitable flats or rooms, it is a good idea to check the following websites regularly. Some of these allow you to save searches and set alerts for your search criteriat that will sent an automated email to yourself.</p>
			<p>Private rented accommodations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Studentpad</li>
				<li>Accommodation for Students</li>
				<li>Edinburgh Room Rentals</li>
				<li>Letting Web</li>
				<li>City Lets</li>
				<li>Gumtree</li>
				<li>Rightmove</li>
				<li>Zoopla</li>
				<li>Shareroom</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You may also need to arrive a few weeks prior to your desired move-in date in order to allot enough time for viewings and finalising lease agreements, as many rented accommodations will require an in-person viewing first. Other places to look out for accommodation listings include newspapers, noticeboards around the city and a dedicated facebook group called "EdinRoom". Additionally, many landlords will post “For Rent” signs outside of available flats, so it may be worthwhile to walk through some of your desired neighbourhoods.</p>
			<h3>Stay safe!</h3>
			<h4>Important: avoid scams</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Be sure to view the accommodation prior to sending money to ensure that the listing is genuine. A common scam is to ask for a deposit upfront before viewing in order to secure the accommodation. Verify that the landlord is genuine as well before parting with any money.</li>
				<li>You can find out if the landlord and the property are registered by visiting the <a href="https://www.landlordregistrationscotland.gov.uk/Pages/Process.aspx?Command=ShowHomePage">Landord Registration Scotland website</a> and entering the address of the property. If you cannot find the property then you can call or email the Council's landlord registration team to double check on <strong>0131 469 5293</strong> or email them at <strong>landlordregistration@edinburgh.gov.uk</strong>. If they are not registered, you should not rent from them.</li>
				<li>If you would like to check if your letting agency is legitimate you could check the following websites, although membership here is voluntary. </li>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.arla.co.uk/">Association of Rental Letting Agents</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.nalscheme.co.uk/">National Approved Letting Scheme</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.tpos.co.uk/find-a-member">The Property Ombudsman</a></li>
				</ul>
				<li>If you have been the victim of a scam you can <a href="https://www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/adviceplace/safetyandcrime/reportingacrime/">contact the University police team here</a>. </li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Know your rights as a tenant:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Terms, conditions and guides to renting: <a href="https://rentingscotland.org/">www.rentingscotland.org</a></li>
				<li>You may be required to have a UK guarantor, as proof of funding. If you are an international student or do not have access to a guarantor, you may be asked to pay 3-6 months worth of rent upfront in order to prove your financial status. </li>
				<li>Students are generally exempt from paying Council Tax, provided that you study for more than 21 hours per week for more than 24 weeks per year. <a href="http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20005/council_tax">See the Council Tax website</a> for more information.</li>
				<li><strong>Read your lease carefully before signing.</strong> Photograph the state of the flat when you first move in and bring any issues found up to the landlord in writing, in case of later dispute. Request a receipt for your deposit.</li>
